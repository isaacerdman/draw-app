Link [here](https://isaacerdman.github.io/draw-app/) 

This is a simple work-in-progress app that explores the ins and outs of Typescript, React, and Tailwind.

The main experiment so far has forced a deeper understanding of states in React.

Features to add:
-  Allow color to be selected
-  Eraser
-  Change size
-  Display feature to be drawn instead of mouse cursor
